# Todo App in Vanilla Javascript

## Stack

I have used HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap to make this application.

## Description

This app can be used to keep track of the upcoming tasks. We can add a task with a tag of its importance level, we can also delete a task with a delete button. As we are saving all the data in the local storage we can have the data even if we reload the page.
